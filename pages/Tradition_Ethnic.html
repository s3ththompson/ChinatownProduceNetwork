          This is sample text. Fruits hold great significance in Chinese culture, not only for their nutritional value but also for their symbolism and cultural traditions. Certain fruits are considered auspicious and are often served during special occasions, such as weddings and Lunar New Year celebrations. For example, oranges are a symbol of good luck and prosperity, while pomelos represent abundance and success.

          Fruits are also an important part of traditional Chinese medicine, where they are used for their healing properties. For instance, goji berries are believed to boost the immune system and improve vision, while lychees are used to treat coughs and fevers.
          
          Moreover, fruits play a significant role in Chinese art and literature. They are often depicted in paintings and poems, with each fruit representing different qualities and emotions. For instance, the peach symbolizes longevity and immortality, while the pomegranate represents fertility and abundance.
          
          In summary, fruits are deeply embedded in Chinese culture, not only for their health benefits but also for their symbolic meaning and cultural significance.
